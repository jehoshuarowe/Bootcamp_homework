Hey my name is Jehoshua Rowe Im currently taking this program to learn about coding
my background is actually jamaican decent. 


My career goals is to eventually become a protfolio manager of assests that i can then use in order to actually use and funding I also joined this course to actually learn about creating some cool stuff when it comes to actually trading thats the reason why i actually joined this prograhm in the first place when it comes to this. 
Now with that being said learn ing about this stuff ahs been a chalenging thing but ik thats its going to be worth it in the end eventually. Comeing form the music industry I wanted to seek an way start my very own hedge fund that i could leverage in to doing other things I can also put back all of this into the community and use as a means of in investing back into the community that way I could also then use other things that can be used to for other stuff at the time as well which can also be a good things aswell.


I choose this because I was currently learn how to trade using form of indicators I wanted to then learn more about the 
statisic aspects of stuff for us to use. I decided to use all so every thing else in order to atuallt lern about this and apllie it in every aarea of my life which would do the greatest thing every when it comes to making money that I can use for other things aswell. But i had to also learn this stuff aswell in order to be able to pply it to other stuff which could be of a great investment to me aswell. but all so in the fact of taking other things learning other techincal stuff as well i would make sense to actually learn other things that can be applied to other things. It would make sense that using other things to use as a way to learn learn other things in order to be using this as a means as getting this to be used for trading then actaully using this for then funding other business. This could be used for other things aswell.
